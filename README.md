# DOTS
> A simple tool for managing dotfiles with VCS

Dotfile management is currently a mess. It seems that no tools follow the UNIX
philosophy when it comes to this simple task. `dots` makes managing dotfiles
extremely easy by effortlessly stowing your dotfiles into a predefined directory
(by default `~/.dotfiles`) and creating relative symbolic links to the stowed
files. The user is then free to manage the dotfile directory in the way that
best fits their workflow.
